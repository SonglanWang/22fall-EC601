API directory is the project2. I develop a library that I can get the tweets using Twitter API and analyze the sentiments. 
In this project, I take myself as a fan of Lebron James. And I can get the tweets including LBJ using twitter_streamer.py. After that, use RapidAPI's Sentiment 
Analysis API to analyze the sentiments to LBJ and get the results. The output is stored in Test_output.txt.
